# Deep-Learning
This repository contains all the notebooks I made while getting started with deep learning and Keras.
I have learned following techniques:
<ul>
  <li> writing a plain sequential model </li>
  <li> callbacks </li>
  <li> writing and training custom cnn model </li>
  <li> image data generator </li>
  <li> visualizing cnn layers </li>
</ul>
